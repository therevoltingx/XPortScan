Currently I only support three compilers, Dev-C++ and Borland for windows, and gcc for Linux.

Dev-C++:
You must have the latest Dev-C++ (currently version 4.9.8.0)
Plus you must have these development kits for dev-c++:
ImageLib (http://bloodshed.net/dev/packages/imagelib.html)
wxWindows Development Kit v. 2.40 for Dev-C++. (http://bloodshed.net/dev/packages/wxwindows.html)

After installing these packages:
Open xportscan.dev in the src directory and press F9 to compile.


Borland:
You must have wxWindows installed, and compiled, this is somewhat harder for Borland.
It is simple if you read their documentation, and with some experince.
After that:
From a command prompt, simply:
make -f makefile.b32

Linux:

You must have wxGtk 2.40 or later installed in your system, either from source or 
from an RPM (not tested).

From a shell:
./configure
make

---------
optionally:
su
<password>
make install
------------------


to clean:
make clean
