Port Scanning is more of an art. <br>
With time you learn to be stealthy.  But you will learn that with time and research,
I am not here to teach you that.
<br>
<br>
<b>
Speed:
</b>
<br>
XportScan uses a technique known as threading to make port scanning as fast as possible.
<br>
(Windows note: Right now I have yet to seen a port scanner that is as fast or faster then XportScan.)
<br>
To increase speed you can select to only scan ports from portlist.txt and increase the number of threads.
<br><br>
<b>
Threads (Warning):
</b>
<br>
If you select too many threads the XportScan may crash, so I recommend just sticking to the default value
but it all depends on how fast and powerfull your system is.<br>
For example, under Windows, if you are scanning yourself, you may want to increase the number of threads, around 500.
<br>
But, if you are scanning yourself under Linux, disable threads, this increases speed dramatically.
