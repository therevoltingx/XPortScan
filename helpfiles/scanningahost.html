To scan a host simply type in the address (i.e. yahoo.com)
or ip (i.e. 127.0.0.1).
<br>
Then click on scan to start scanning.
<br>
<br>
There are a few options:
<br><br>
<b>Scan Type:</b><br>
You can specify which scan method to use.
<br>
(Note: for now only connect is supported)
<br>
<br>
<b>Ports To Scan: </b><br>
By default XportScan only scans the most used ports read from portlist.txt.
<br>
You can specify which port to scan by choosing custom.

(Note: There are a maximum of 65535 ports in a system.)
<br>
<br>
<b>Timeout</b>
<br>
Not currently used.</br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Threads</b>
<br>
Specify the maximum number of threads XportScan can use.</br>
<br><br>
<b>Raw Packet Delay</b><br>
Not currently used.
<br>
<br>
<b>
Note:</b><br>
XPortScan, by default, scans only ports 1-1024 plus the most common used ports read from the portlist.txt
file.<br>
You can upgrade the portlist.txt with any file that uses the same format (which is actually the nmap-services file)
<br>
<br>
Read the tips section for notes on the advanced options.
